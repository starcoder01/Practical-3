    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
        Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),Cascading Style Sheeets (CSS) and
        JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming.
        It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive
        HTML5 website designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
